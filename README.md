Data-Structures

Though to be honest there's no reason for anyone to use these examples anyway.  These examples are not particularly suited for use in proffesional applications (there are much better existing libraries for that). They are instead meant to serve as examples of basic straightforward implementations of their types to aid in the understanding of the mechanics of data structures.  In this manner they are mostly useful to students of computer science, who should try to write their own implementations anyway.
